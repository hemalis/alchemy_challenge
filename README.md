# Surf Up Analysis
## Overview of Project
### Purpose

Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 

## Results
### Comparison between June and December temperatures

1. Looking at the tables below mean temperatures in Oahu in June and december are 75 and 71 respectively. Those are perfect for some ice cream and surf. 
2. Minimum temperature in June is 64 and in December is 56. That's little cold in december but not that bad as 75% is still 74.  
3. Maximum temperature in June is 85 and in December is 83. That's very close to each other.

### Other queries to get more weather data?
- One more weather data point that can be analyzed is wind speed as that's really imporatant for surfing. We can query wind speed for both the months ant that can provide more information. 
- We can map temperatures with precipitation for each month and see how good it is for surfing. Also, cloud data is important to have as well to understand more about weather data.
